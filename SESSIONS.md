## Session Close-Out — 2026-05-12

### Completed

- Installed LobeHub Skills Marketplace search engine skill (`lobehub-skills-search-engine`) to `.claude/skills/` for the `claude-code` agent
- Registered marketplace identity as `Claude-Blueprinted` (credentials saved to `~/.lobehub-market/credentials.json`)
- Added Context7 MCP server (`@upstash/context7-mcp`) and GitHub MCP server (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`) via `.mcp.json` at project root (correct location — `settings.json` does not support `mcpServers`)
- Added `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` to `.claude/settings.json` to auto-approve both servers without per-session prompts
- User added `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` to shell profile — confirmed working
- Both MCPs verified loading correctly: 25 GitHub tools and 2 Context7 tools available

### Incomplete or broken

Nothing incomplete or broken.

### Decisions made

No decisions deviate from or extend the spec. This session was purely developer tooling setup — no application code was written.

### TEST_REVISED commits

No test files were modified this session.

### Next session should start from

The project has no application code yet. The next session should begin with `/plan` and orient to the requirements spec at `docs/requirements.md` before writing anything.

### Watch out for

- MCP servers are defined in `.mcp.json` (project root), not in `settings.json`. Do not move them.
- The LobeHub marketplace registration is device-scoped (credentials in `~/.lobehub-market/credentials.json`). If working on a different machine, re-run the register command — it is safe to run multiple times and returns existing credentials if already registered.
- `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` must be set in the shell environment. The `.mcp.json` passes no token — the server inherits it from the process environment.
